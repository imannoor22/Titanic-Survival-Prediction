# Titanic-Survival-Prediction

- The dataset used in this project is the well-known Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers and their survival status and a unique opportunity to apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning algorithms.

- This project concludes with trained machine learning models that predict passenger survival with a certain accuracy. Visualizations and insights gained from the dataset can also be found in the notebooks.
